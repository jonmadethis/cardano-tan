# Fan-Tan Contract Recovery Procedures

This document outlines the standard operating procedures for contract backup, emergency responses, and recovery operations.

## Automated Backup System

The contract implements an automated backup system that operates continuously. The system maintains detailed records of contract state, including all active games, pending transactions, and operational parameters.

### Backup Schedule

The system performs backups at the following intervals:
1. Full state backups every hour
2. Incremental state updates every 5 minutes
3. Transaction log backups in real-time

### Backup Verification

Each backup undergoes multiple verification steps:
1. Checksum validation
2. State consistency checks
3. Transaction log integrity verification
4. Cross-reference with on-chain data

## Emergency Shutdown Procedures

The contract includes automated shutdown procedures that can be activated in response to critical situations.

### Activation Criteria

Emergency shutdown is automatically triggered under the following conditions:
1. Critical security vulnerabilities detected
2. Severe network disruptions affecting contract operation
3. Abnormal transaction patterns indicating potential attacks
4. System state inconsistencies beyond acceptable thresholds

### Shutdown Process

The shutdown sequence follows these steps:
1. Immediate pause of new transaction acceptance
2. Creation of final state backup
3. Completion of all pending valid transactions
4. Creation of recovery snapshot
5. Administrator notification
6. Contract deactivation

## Fund Recovery Mechanisms

The contract implements secure mechanisms for fund recovery in emergency situations.

### Recovery Authorization

Fund recovery requires:
1. Multi-signature approval from authorized administrators
2. Verification of emergency conditions
3. Confirmation of backup integrity
4. Validation of recovery destination addresses

### Recovery Process

The recovery process includes:
1. Verification of current contract state
2. Collection of all contract UTXOs
3. Construction of recovery transactions
4. Multi-signature authorization
5. Phased execution of recovery
6. Verification of fund transfers

## State Restoration Protocol

The system provides mechanisms for restoring contract state from verified backups.

### Restoration Planning

Before restoration begins:
1. Load and verify selected backup
2. Create detailed restoration plan
3. Estimate resource requirements
4. Identify potential risks
5. Prepare rollback procedures

### Restoration Process

The restoration follows these steps:
1. Contract pause initiation
2. Backup data validation
3. State reconstruction
4. Transaction log replay
5. State verification
6. Gradual service restoration

## Recovery Testing

Regular testing ensures the effectiveness of recovery procedures.

### Test Schedule

The following tests are performed regularly:
1. Monthly backup restoration drills
2. Quarterly emergency shutdown tests
3. Semi-annual full recovery simulations
4. Annual comprehensive disaster recovery exercises

### Test Verification

Each test must verify:
1. Data integrity maintained
2. All funds properly accounted for
3. State consistency preserved
4. Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
5. Security controls maintained

## Administrator Guidelines

Guidelines for administrators managing recovery operations.

### Authorization Levels

Recovery operations require different authorization levels:
1. Level 1: Basic backup operations
2. Level 2: Emergency shutdown initiation
3. Level 3: Fund recovery authorization
4. Level 4: Complete state restoration

### Communication Protocols

During recovery operations:
1. Use secure communication channels
2. Follow predefined notification procedures
3. Maintain detailed operation logs
4. Document all decisions and actions
5. Prepare incident reports

## Monitoring and Reporting

Continuous monitoring ensures early detection of potential issues.

### Monitoring Metrics

Key metrics monitored include:
1. Backup success rates
2. State consistency measures
3. Transaction processing times
4. System resource utilization
5. Security event indicators

### Reporting Requirements

Regular reports must include:
1. Backup operation status
2. Recovery readiness assessment
3. Test results and findings
4. System health indicators
5. Recommended improvements

## Post-Recovery Procedures

After successful recovery operations:

### Verification Steps

1. Confirm data integrity
2. Verify state consistency
3. Validate all balances
4. Check security parameters
5. Test core functionality

### Documentation Requirements

Maintain records of:
1. Recovery operation details
2. Decisions and authorizations
3. Technical procedures executed
4. Issues encountered
5. Lessons learned
